## Running from the Roc

As the [[Roc of Mount Ghakis]] is distracted by [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mordenkainen]], the group makes their getaway. [[Bardolf]] is able to grab up the chariot and drag it across the bridge, losing only the wooden horse. [[Pelanil]] dismisses the green flames at the gate, and the group is able to get away without the [[Roc]] following them.

On the way to [[The Wizard of Wines (W)|The Winery]], [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mordenkainen]] drunkenly tells the party he was able to secure the broom from a hag selling pies.
