## Running from the Roc

As the [[Roc of Mount Ghakis]] is distracted by [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mordenkainen]], the group makes their getaway. [[Bardolf]] is able to grab up the chariot and drag it across the bridge, losing only the wooden horse. [[Pelanil]] dismisses the green flames at the gate, and the group is able to get away without the [[Roc]] following them.

On the way to [[The Wizard of Wines (W)|The Winery]], [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mordenkainen]] drunkenly tells the party he was able to secure the broom from a hag selling pies.

## Rest at the Winery

The party preps for their final battle with [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] at [[The Wizard of Wines (W)|The Winery]] with [[The Keepers of the Feather|The Martikovs]]. The characters do the following:

### Anakir

[[Anakir]] and [[Escher]] have a long discussion about [[Escher]]'s going back to [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Castle Ravenloft]]. [[Escher]] knew that the wolves on the bridge were sent for him, but was adamant that he wanted to join the party for the final battle. After much discussion, [[Anakir]] convinces him that he should stay back at [[The Wizard of Wines (W)|The Winery]] for both his sake and the sake of the party ([[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] may compel [[Escher]] to attack his friends).

### Elora

[[Elora]] goes for long walks spanning entire days. She thinks about her brother, [[Izek Strazni|Izek]], and practices her psychic blades.

### Shalooti

[[Shalooti]] writes a song about [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] that includes untrue rumors about the land's king.

### Bardolf

[[Bardolf]] creates magical items for many of the party members:
- shalooti: pipes of the sewers: enemy rats it automatically charms them
- elora: gauntlets of ogre power
- anakir: slippers of spider climbing
- bardolf: winged boots, gloves of missile snaring


Elora had a moment of reflection and asked if we really wanna do this. We might die. Pelanil gave his speech
