## Running from the Roc

As the [[Roc of Mount Ghakis]] is distracted by [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mordenkainen]], the group makes their getaway. [[Bardolf]] is able to grab up the chariot and drag it across the bridge, losing only the wooden horse. [[Pelanil]] dismisses the green flames at the gate, and the group is able to get away without the [[Roc]] following them.

On the way to [[The Wizard of Wines (W)|The Winery]], [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mordenkainen]] drunkenly tells the party he was able to secure the broom from a hag selling pies.

## Rest at the Winery

The party preps for their final battle with [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] at [[The Wizard of Wines (W)|The Winery]] with [[The Keepers of the Feather|The Martikovs]]. They stay there for 5 days along with [[The Keepers of the Feather|The Martikovs]], [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]], [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mordenkainen]], [[Escher]], and [[Rictavio]]. The characters do the following:

### Anakir

[[Anakir]] and [[Escher]] have a long discussion about [[Escher]]'s going back to [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Castle Ravenloft]]. [[Escher]] knew that the wolves on the bridge were sent for him, but was adamant that he wanted to join the party for the final battle. After much discussion, [[Anakir]] convinces him that he should stay back at [[The Wizard of Wines (W)|The Winery]] for both his sake and the sake of the party ([[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] may compel [[Escher]] to attack his friends).

### Elora

[[Elora]] goes for long walks spanning entire days. She thinks about her brother, [[Izek Strazni|Izek]], and practices her psychic blades.

### Shalooti

[[Shalooti]] writes a song about [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] that includes untrue rumors about the land's king.

### Bardolf

[[Bardolf]] creates magical items for many of the party members:
- shalooti: pipes of the sewers: enemy rats it automatically charms them
- elora: gauntlets of ogre power
- anakir: slippers of spider climbing
- bardolf: winged boots, gloves of missile snaring

### Pelanil

[[Pelanil]] created enchanted stones for each of the party members and told them they would work when the time is right.

He also took the time to read the [[Tome of Understanding]] and planted the now re-aligned [[Gulthias Staff|Goodthias Staff]] near the [[Gulthias tree]] at [[Yester Hill (Y)|Yester Hill]] in hopes of breeding a [[Goodthias Tree]].

Finally, [[Pelanil]] sent out messages to all their allies throughout Barovia using [[Sending]]. Included in the each of the messages was [[Shalooti]]'s song. He sent the message to the following people:
- [[The Keepers of the Feather|The Martikovs]] in [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]]
- [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] wherever he ended up
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] in [[Village of Barovia (E)|Barovia Village]]
	- He responded with "I know what you did"

After each of his preparations, [[Pelanil]] cast [[Augury]]. He continue to receive Woes until he sent out [[Shalooti]]'s song at which point he received a Weal and Woe.

## Plan of Attack

After their five days of preparation, the party gathered in the dining room of [[The Wizard of Wines (W)|The Wizard of Wines]] to discuss their plan for getting into [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Castle Ravenloft]] and killing [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]. The scene was both merry and somber as the party drank and celebrated as well as reflected during what might be their last night alive.

Elora had a moment of reflection and asked if the party really wanted to go through with this, as there is a strong chance they may all die. [[Davian Martikov|Davian]] echoed her concern, and [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mordenkainen]] shared that he had once already failed an attack on [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]. Pelanil gave an uplifting and encouraging speech to the group.

They planned the following:
- Get into the castle through the servants' entrance
- Head straight for the [[Heart of Sorrow Statblock|Heart of Sorrow]]
	- With conversation between [[Escher]] and the [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mad Mage]], the party felt like they knew where it was in the castle
- Clear the castle as best they can
- Find and fight [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
- [[Rictavio]] will stay behind as he is cursed by [[Vistani]] that everyone he loves shall die
	- this is why he believes [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] died
	- if he accompanies the party, he's confident they will also die
- [[Escher]] will stay behind as [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] may turn him on the party
- [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mordenkainen]] will join
