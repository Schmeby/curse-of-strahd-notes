## Jesus?

As the rest of the party is having dinner, [[Pelanil]] finds his way to the castle's chapel. There, something catches his eye on the alter: a sliver statuette, and below it, a corpse. [[Pelanil]] inspects the scene and surmises that the person on the alter must have been killed by the figurine. Throwing caution to the wind, [[Pelanil]] grabs the statuette. He is immediately blown backwards by a burst of radiant light. [[Piccolo]] watches on, amused at the entertainment.

Nearly dead, [[Pelanil]] collapses onto the closest pew, his body tingling from the radiant blast. He hears a voice:

>My son, I have gone to great lengths to come to you in this realm. There is yet hope for your soul. Travel to [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]] and speak with [[The Abbot]].

After a flashback to [[Pelanil's Conversation with Menigal]], [[Pelanil]] feels somewhat changed after this message from his deity, [[Jesus|Jesus Christ of Nazareth]]. Through [[Pelanil]]'s evil shell, his faith is rekindled, and he rises immediately from the pew and sets forth towards [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]].

## After Dinner

[[Pelanil]] finds the party in the dinning hall, [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] having already retired for the night. [[Anakir]] continues to flirt with [[Escher]]. [[Anakir]] calls it a night early, and [[Escher]] slips out of the room a bit later.

[[Pelanil]] insists that the group head towards [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]] immediately, but [[Elora]] thinks that they should at least spend the night so that [[Pelanil]] can heal since he seems to still be smoking from his incident.

As the others argue over the group's next move, [[Shalooti]] sits in the corner messing around with her new deck of cards. Finally, her curiosity gets the best of her, and she pulls a single card from the deck. She feels her bag get immediately lighter, and she notices she's lost nearly all of her GP.

The group follow [[Cyrus Belview|Cyrus]] back upstairs to bed.

## Bed Time Shenanigans 

[[Shalooti]] rejects [[Bardolf]]'s offer to share a room, but [[Bardolf]], unperturbed, sets out chiseling a peephole in the wall between their rooms that he uses to watch her sleep. He patches it before she wakes in the morning.

At first, he mistakenly chisels a hole in the wrong wall into the room where [[Pelanil]] is staying. There, he sees [[Pelanil]] awakened by someone at his door. [[Pelanil]] punches a hole through it and seems to just go back to bed. [[Pelanil]] casts [[Magic Circle]] to protect himself during the night.

[[Anakir]] and [[Escher]] engage in some pillow talk. [[Anakir]] asks [[Escher]] to leave [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Castle Ravenloft]] and join him and the rest of the party. [[Escher]] explains that it's not that easy. It's true that [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] has lost interest in him recently, but as a vampire spawn, [[Escher]] has no choice but to follow [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s orders. If [[Escher]] were to leave to be with [[Anakir]], he couldn't guarantee that he wouldn't hurt him. Their bed suddenly pushed up against the wall by [[Pelanil]]'s spell.

## Strahd's Proposition

[[Elora]], feeling mischievous, had snuck down the hall to make noise outside of [[Pelanil]]'s room. Already on edge, [[Pelanil]] leaped from his bed and punched a hole through the door, striking [[Elora]]. With her pride damaged, she made her way back to her room.

There, she found [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] sitting on her bed. He asked her to come inside and close the door. Worried what [[Pelanil]] would do if he saw, she obliged.

>Elora, you intrigue me. Unlike the others, you do not shy away from the darkness, but rather seek to understand it. That is a rare quality, one I respect deeply. You are not like the others. You see beyond the veil of fear that blinds them. You seek knowledge, truth... perhaps even power. I could help you find all three.

[[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] told her that he didn't request full betrayal of her friends, but that sometimes, the good of the many requires the sacrifice from the few. He recognized that the party was searching for the [[Misc/Campaign Items/Sunsword]], and that their finding it could spell ruin for his kingdom.

What he had to offer [[Elora]] was a partnership: if she was willing to do one small task for him (namely, retrieve the [[Misc/Campaign Items/Sunsword]] for him before her friends were able to do it), then he would make her Queen Consort to rule Barovia alongside him.

Seeing the indecision on her face, [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] told [[Elora]] to sleep on it, and to get word to him of her decision.

## Leaving Castle Ravenloft

[[Cyrus Belview|Cyrus]] brought up pastries the next morning, and told the party that the carriage waited outside for them to take them anywhere they'd like in Barovia. [[Bardolf]] asked if they could make pit stops at a few different locations, but [[Cyrus Belview|Cyrus]] told him the carriage didn't work that way. [[Cyrus Belview|Cyrus]] also mentioned that he had family in [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]].

The group loaded into the carriage, [[Anakir]] disappointed that [[Escher]] chose to stay behind. [[Elora]] arrives a bit late, and the wagon starts moving. Just as it pulls away, [[Escher]] comes running to join [[Anakir]]. He had been meeting with [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] to tell him that he would join the party to spy on them, to which [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] replied, "Finally, you are of some use".

## Elora's Puppets

Before leaving her room, [[Elora]] pulled out the [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] and [[Elora]] dolls that she'd been carrying with her. She placed them on the dresser in her room, both sitting side-by-side with crowns on their heads, with a dagger through the chest of [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s doll. It seems she had made her decision.

## More Cards

[[Shalooti]] continues to play with her new deck of cards. She pulls two. The wagon is immediately struck by a fireball, and [[Shalooti]] turns into a thorny plant.
