## The Sound of Wings

Instead of investigating the hooded rider, the group decides to turn back to rest for the night. They head back up the road just a bit to the guard tower the just passed.  [[Elora]] and [[Anakir]] scaled the tower and climbed inside the window on the second floor. [[Anakir]] went downstairs and unbarred the door for the rest of the party while [[Elora]] investigated the roof.

On the roof, [[Elora]] saw multiple skeletons with ruined weapons and armor. Down the cliff laid the valley over 500 feet below. Looking back down the path they came, she saw the wolves paused on the path, seeming to give up for the night. Looking forward to the bridge, she saw no more sign of the hooded rider.

The group started a fire and settled in for the night. [[Shalooti]] awoke to a change in the sound of the wind. [[Rictavio|van Richten]] also noticed the sound, but he chalked it up to just a change in the wind. He told [[Shalooti]] about the legend of the [[Roc of Mount Ghakis]] as well as the legend of [[Sangzor]] the giant goat. He says he's not concerned as these are only stories.

In the morning, the party makes their way to the [[The Amber Temple (X)|Amber Temple]], and arrive after an hour with no other trouble.

## Into the Temple

Investigating the front, the party gets the sense that this temple was not built for evil, but must have been later melded to serve evil. Inside, the group begins to investigate. [[Anakir]] makes psychic contact through a translucent amber door to someone on the other side. After a conversation in broken Common, [[Anakir]] casts invisibility and looks inside where he sees multiple large humanoids and a wolf. We informs the party and they explore elsewhere.

[[Escher]] becomes bored with the party's search, and lies in the floor. Impatient, [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] makes her way down the stairs to the main temple. Halfway down the stairs, she's struck by a fire bolt, and [[Pelanil]] pulls her back up the stairs. She apologizes for running off in haste. [[Bardolf]] attempts to light up the temple by throwing a rock. He hits a 40-foot tall statue on the other side of the huge room. A fireball immediately issues from the statue's hooded face, and the party enters combat.
