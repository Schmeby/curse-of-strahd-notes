## Saving the Books

[[Neferon|The Furry]] turns to [[Elora]] and asks why they have come to the [[The Amber Temple (X)|Amber Temple]]. He continues to try to snuff out the flames. [[Elora]] questions him, and he tells her that his duty is to protect the evil locked away in this temple from those who wish to free it.

[[Pelanil]] burst through the open trap door. [[Neferon|The Furry]] agrees to call off the flameskulls and have a conversation with the party over tea.

## Tea with Neferon

[[Neferon|The Furry]] introduces himself as [[Neferon]], a dimension-wandering Arcanaloth. Through conversation, he tells the party the following:

- He worked with good-aligned wizards centuries ago to lock away all the [[Dark Powers]] in the [[The Amber Temple (X)|Amber Temple]]
	- They also gathered the world's dark knowledge and stored it away so that they could protect it
		- [[Elora]] points out the oversight in gathering it all in one place
- After successfully trapping the [[Dark Powers]], [[Neferon]] continued dimension traveling
	- When he returned, all his wizard friends had been corrupted
	- Two of the [[Dark Powers]] had been released
- When [[Elora]] asks him to transport them out of Barovia, he says he is duty-bound to guard the temple and cannot leave again

He tells the group to venture further into [[The Amber Temple (X)|The Amber Temple]] to find "his friend". He would be able to share more information with the party. He warns the crew that he must kill them if they try to interact with the [[Dark Powers]] locked away in the amber sarcophagi.

The party takes a quick rest over tea and makes their way back out of the statue and to the secret door that [[Bardolf]] found earlier.

## I See You've Found Our Library

The group tries to open the door with force, but is unable to budge it. [[Bardolf]] pulls out a hammer and chisel. They also seem to have no effect until he plays "Shave and a Haircut", to which the door creaks open revealing a dark stone staircase leading upwards.

Another secret door at the top swings open allowing the party access to a vast library. The knowledge held in the room seems unfathomable with bookshelves ascending out of sight and high into the mountain.

As the party investigates the books, [[Anakir]] feels breath on his shoulder and hears a raspy voice say "I see you've found our library".

[[Exethanter|The Lich]] tells the party that this library contains endless knowledge and that they can find the answers to any question they've ever had.

Upon questioning, he also reveals the following:
- He was also once a wizard that helped seal away all the [[Dark Powers]]
- He was friends with [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]], who he remembers as a "strapping young lad" finding his way in the Barovian Valley
	- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] has not been back to visit for a long time
- There are two rituals needed to seal away a dark power
	- Ritual one (summon the [[Dark Powers|Dark Power]]:
		- As a ritual, three casters must proceed with the spell for 10 uninterrupted minutes
	- Ritual two (trap it in amber):
		- as a ritual, one caster must succeed on 3 consecutive magic checks in their spell casting ability, DC 16.
		- the caster must be able to see the [[Dark Powers|Dark Power]] for each roll. They can't be in a different room or casting blindly in darkness. They've got to see the beast to imprison it.
		- And lastly, the ritual requires a chip of amber as a component
- He's obviously very forgetful, and doesn't even know his own name

## The Magic Lightsaber

[[Pelanil]] made his way down the spiral staircase in the library. At the bottom, he found 3 amber sarcophagi from which he sensed great evil emanating. [[Pelanil]] used [[Locate Object]] to try to find the [[Misc/Campaign Items/Sunsword|Sunsword]]. It led him through the cracks in the southern wall of the room. There, he found 6 piles of treasure. [[Elora]] scampered past him to claim the pile with the wooden pony.

[[Elora]] gave the [[Handouts/Items/Sunsword|Sunsword]] to [[Pelanil]] since she was only interested in the live-size wooden pony. The party continued to ponder how they would remove all this treasure from the temple. [[Pelanil]] admired his new sentient companion.
