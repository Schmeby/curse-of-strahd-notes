## Treasure and Knowledge

The party took their favorite items from the treasury and loaded them into the chariot which [[Bardolf]] hooked to [[Metarlos]]. [[Pelanil]] asked [[Exethanter|The Lich]] some more questions and learned:

- There was once an entire dimension called the Core but, over the course of time, this dimension was split into a multitude of small, isolated dimensions, or, Demiplanes
	- Barovia is one of these demiplanes
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] has the following traits:
	- He can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants
	- He is harmed by running water
	- He is hypersensitive to sunlight
	- He is immune to non-magical weapon damage
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] used to be friends with [[Exethanter|The Lich]]
	- this put him in close proximity to [[Vampyr]]
	- [[Vampyr]] corrupted [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] and convinced him that he could be made immortal
	- On [[Sergei]]'s wedding day, [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] killed his brother, completing the bond with [[Vampyr]] and giving the [[Dark Powers|Dark Power]] the strength to break free from his amber sarcophagus
- Someone else had since broken into the temple and also freed [[Menigal, the Departed|Menigal]]

When [[Pelanil]] asked about the layout of [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Ravenloft]], [[Exethanter|The Lich]] told him that the plans for the castle were drawn up in this temple. He escorted the group to the architect's room where there was a model replica of [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Castle Ravenloft]]. [[Exethanter|The Lich]] looked to find that the blueprints of the castle had been stolen, but gave [[Pelanil]] a [[Tome of Understanding]]. The group spent time inspecting the model so that they would have an easier time navigating the castle once they arrive.
