## Treasure and Knowledge

The party took their favorite items from the treasury and loaded them into the chariot which [[Bardolf]] hooked to [[Metarlos]]. [[Pelanil]] asked [[Exethanter|The Lich]] some more questions and learned:

- There was once an entire dimension called the Core but, over the course of time, this dimension was split into a multitude of small, isolated dimensions, or, Demiplanes
	- Barovia is one of these demiplanes
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] has the following traits:
	- He can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants
	- He is harmed by running water
	- He is hypersensitive to sunlight
	- He is immune to non-magical weapon damage
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] used to be friends with [[Exethanter|The Lich]]
	- this put him in close proximity to [[Vampyr]]
	- [[Vampyr]] corrupted [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] and convinced him that he could be made immortal
	- On [[Sergei]]'s wedding day, [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] killed his brother, completing the bond with [[Vampyr]] and giving the [[Dark Powers|Dark Power]] the strength to break free from his amber sarcophagus
- Someone else had since broken into the temple and also freed [[Menigal, the Departed|Menigal]]

When [[Pelanil]] asked about the layout of [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Ravenloft]], [[Exethanter|The Lich]] told him that the plans for the castle were actually drawn up in this very temple. He escorted the group to the architect's room where there was a replica model of [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Castle Ravenloft]]. [[Exethanter|The Lich]] searched a chest to find that the detailed blueprints of the castle had been stolen, but gave [[Pelanil]] a [[Tome of Understanding]]. The group spent time inspecting the model so that they would have an easier time navigating the castle once they arrive.

## Birds and Wolves

The party decided they would head towards [[The Wizard of Wines (W)|The Wizard of Wines]] for a rest even though evening was setting in. With the chariot of treasure in tow, the party made their way back down the treacherous mountain trail.

After an hour of travel, they arrived at the [[Tsolenka Pass (T)|Tsolenka Pass]] and were greeted by wolves blocking the bridge. [[Escher]] knew they had come for him. The wolves and a leader dire wolf tried to kill [[Escher]], but the party easily destroyed them. Just when they think they are in the clear, a huge [[Roc]] flies in from nowhere and grabs [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]]. [[Pelanil]] is able to free her the first time, but the second time, the [[Roc]] throws her from the bridge to the river 500 feet below.

[[Bardolf]] and [[Shalooti]] mount [[Metarlos]] and make their way across the bridge just as the [[Roc]] lands behind them blocking passage for the rest of the party.

[[Pelanil]] sees a figure riding on a broom. It's [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mordenkainen]], drunk off his ass, shouting "It's time, it's time. Let's go kill Strahd." [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mordenkainen]] distracts the [[Roc]] as the party prepares to flee...
