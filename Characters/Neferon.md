## Playing Neferon

## History/Info

- Hangs out inside the head of the statue in the [[The Amber Temple (X)|Amber Temple]]
- Attacks characters on sight with the longer-ranged spells
- Because of truesight, he can see the invisible and can see through the magical darkness around the statue head
- It wears small gold spectacles with pink crystal lenses (worth 250 gp) and a [[Robe of Useful Items]] with the following eight patches remaining:
	- Bag of 100 gp
	- Iron door
	- Wooden ladder
	- Riding horse
	- Pit
	- Rowboat
	- [[Spell Scroll]] ([[Moonbeam]])
	- Mastiffs

- Neferon wears gold spectacles and a magic robe
- It uses its [[Alter Self]] spell and Deception skill to pass itself off as an old human wizard with a long white beard named Heinrich Stolt
- "Heinrich" feigns confusion
- If the characters ask him why he attacked, he claims that he was guarding the temple
- If the Neferon loses more than half of its hit points, it teleports to the temple floor, turns invisible, and flees by the safest route, attacking the characters again when it's safe to do so
- The arcanaloth will not, under any circumstances, leave the Amber Temple
