Week of 5/26: https://meetingbrew.com/strahd-5-26
Week of 6/2: https://meetingbrew.com/lpd874

- [[The Amber Temple (X)|Amber Temple]] reminders:
	- [[Extreme Cold]] 
	- [[Darkvision]] limited to only 20 feet
	- [[Neferon]] attacks as soon as they walk down the stairs
	- [[Exethanter]] meets them inside the safe area

- [[Exethanter]] of course knows how to deal with the [[Dark Powers]] since he trapped them all in amber centuries ago
	- "Of course, Strahd is not who you're looking to defeat"

**How To Deal with the Dark Powers**
- Tell them how to kill [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] in the [[The Amber Temple (X)|Amber Temple]] library
	- Once he is killed, he turns to mist and returns to his coffin where he regenerates
	- There, they have to perform a ritual to either:
		- ~summon the link to [[Vampyr]] and sever it~
			- go ahead and do the harder one
		- summon [[Vampyr]] himself
			- then either:
				- kill [[Vampyr]]
				- or perform a ritual to lock him in an amber shard
	- Ritual one:
		- As a ritual, three casters must proceed with the spell for 10 uninterrupted minutes
		- summons [[Vampyr]]
	- Ritual two:
		- as a ritual one caster must succeed on 3 consecutive magic checks in their spell casting ability, DC 16.
		- you can make the casting of this ritual take bonus actions instead of actions so its easier
		- the caster must be able to see Vampyr for each roll. They can't be in a different room or casting blindly in darkness. They've got to see the beast to imprison it.
		- And lastly, the ritual requires a chip of amber as a component.
