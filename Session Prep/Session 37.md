## Amber Temple
- [[The Amber Temple (X)|Amber Temple]] reminders:
	- [[Extreme Cold]] 
	- [[Darkvision]] limited to only 20 feet
	- [[Neferon]] attacks as soon as they walk down the stairs
	- [[Exethanter]] meets them inside the safe area

- [[Exethanter]] of course knows how to deal with the [[Dark Powers]] since he trapped them all in amber centuries ago
	- "Of course, Strahd is not who you're looking to defeat"

- [[Escher]] can tell the party about the heart of sorrow
	- He knows that there is something deep in the castle that prevents [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] from getting hurt
	- He's heard Strahd mention it before to [[Rahadin]]

## Leaving the Temple

- Wolves will be waiting at the bridge
	- the [[Roc of Mount Ghakis]] will fly in and carry off [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]]
- [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mad Mage]] should come to the rescue, drunk off his ass
- Plz kill [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] and definitely [[Escher]]
	- [[Escher]] CAN NOT go back to the castle with the party or he'll lead them directly to [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
	- or he can turn on the party if he doesn't die here
	- have the wolves target [[Escher]] because of betrayal

## Entering the Castle

- The drawbridge is up, but there is a mechanical way to move it on the other side
	- maybe it magically lowers itself as if Strahd knows they're there
- They may be able to explore for a while, but they could get in trouble and be met by one of the brides

## Final Fight

Tell the party to set expectations:
- this _will_ be a hard fight
- there is a world where this campaign ends with them all dying
- it may not be a super rewarding ending
	- but I think it could still be good story telling
- Of course, I want them to win
	- but I won't go easy on them as Strahd


"While your escapades in my realm have been entertaining, I'm afraid I can no longer allow your crimes to go unpunished. I, Count Strahd von Zarovich, son of King Barov von Zarovich, sentence you to death." Strahd gently places his wine glass on the end table beside his chair. Then, head held high and never breaking eye contact, he rises. With a quick, steady hand, he draws his sword. "Shall we begin?" Roll initiative.
