Week of 6/2: https://meetingbrew.com/lpd874

- [[The Amber Temple (X)|Amber Temple]] reminders:
	- [[Extreme Cold]] 
	- [[Darkvision]] limited to only 20 feet
	- [[Neferon]] attacks as soon as they walk down the stairs
	- [[Exethanter]] meets them inside the safe area

- [[Exethanter]] of course knows how to deal with the [[Dark Powers]] since he trapped them all in amber centuries ago
	- "Of course, Strahd is not who you're looking to defeat"
