- Shalooti writes a rumor folk song shitting on Strahd
	- This can help with recruiting people to the cause when there is the big war outside
- Elora took long walks and practiced her psychic blades
- Bardolf made things
	- shalooti: pipes of the sewers: enemy rats it automatically charms them
	- elora: gauntlets of ogre power
	- anakir: slippers of spider climbing
	- bardolf: winged boots, gloves of missile snaring

	- sent out messages via [[Sending]] including Shalooti's song
		- Martikovs and [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] in Krezk
		- Isek
		- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]
			- responds "I know what you did"
	- read the tome of understanding
	- Planted the "good"thias tree from the staff that was changed along with him
	- 


## Leaving the Temple

- Wolves will be waiting at the bridge
	- the [[Roc of Mount Ghakis]] will fly in and carry off [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]]
- [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mad Mage]] should come to the rescue, drunk off his ass
- Plz kill [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] and definitely [[Escher]]
	- [[Escher]] CAN NOT go back to the castle with the party or he'll lead them directly to [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
	- or he can turn on the party if he doesn't die here
	- have the wolves target [[Escher]] because of betrayal

## Entering the Castle

- The drawbridge is up, but there is a mechanical way to move it on the other side
	- maybe it magically lowers itself as if Strahd knows they're there
- They may be able to explore for a while, but they could get in trouble and be met by one of the brides

- Give advantage on history checks so the group can see if they remember the model they saw in the [[The Amber Temple (X)|Amber Temple]]

## Final Fight

Tell the party to set expectations:
- this _will_ be a hard fight
- there is a world where this campaign ends with them all dying
- it may not be a super rewarding ending
	- but I think it could still be good story telling
- Of course, I want them to win
	- but I won't go easy on them as Strahd


"While your escapades in my realm have been entertaining, I'm afraid I can no longer allow your crimes to go unpunished. I, Count Strahd von Zarovich, son of King Barov von Zarovich, sentence you to death." Strahd gently places his wine glass on the end table beside his chair. Then, head held high and never breaking eye contact, he rises. With a quick, steady hand, he draws his sword. "Shall we begin?" Roll initiative.
